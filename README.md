# Portfolio Web Application


Welcome to my portfolio web application! This project was created as part of a coding challenge to showcase my skills in web development. As I progress in my career, I will continue to add to and refine this portfolio to highlight my strongest work and demonstrate my thought processes behind each project.


## User Story
As an employer, I want to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples so that I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position.


## Acceptance Criteria

-Upon loading the portfolio, the user is presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them.

-Clicking on a link in the navigation scrolls the UI to the corresponding section.

-Clicking on the link to the section about their work scrolls the UI to a section with titled images of the developer's applications.

-The first application's image is larger in size than the others.

-Clicking on the images of the applications takes the user to that deployed application.
The layout is responsive and adapts to different viewport sizes.
